## My process
Still extremely new, so looking at others code, playing about with CSS to see what various chnages and elements do. Using figma to help with spacing and sizing.

### Built with

- html
- css
- VS code
- Figma

### What I learned

* Mouse-over hover states on images to get one to overlay another
* Extremely basic flexbox to get the icons/price/time showing inline

## Acknowledgments

Used the solution from [blaqbox-prime](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/blaqbox-prime) as a starting point, helped out with some of the flex stuff.
